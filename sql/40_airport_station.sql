-- Maps each BTS airport code (IATA) to its IEM weather station and time zone.
-- IEM uses FAA ids in the lower 48 (JFK) but ICAO ids elsewhere (PAFA for FAI,
-- TJSJ for SJU), so try every code OurAirports knows for the airport.
-- Re-coded and closed airports are covered by faa.airport_aliases and faa.airport_closed.
-- Join flights to weather with:  ontime.Origin = airport_station.airport,
--                                weather.station = airport_station.station
