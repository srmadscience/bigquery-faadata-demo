-- IEM ASOS station metadata (location and time zone), one row per station.
-- Station ids are FAA identifiers, which match the BTS Origin/Dest codes for
-- airports in the lower 48; elsewhere IEM uses ICAO codes (PANC, TJSJ), which
-- faa.airport_station resolves. tzname converts BTS local times to UTC.
-- Replaced as a whole by load-stations.sh.
