# Downloads IEM ASOS observations, one gzipped CSV per station per year, into
# data/raw/weather/YEAR/STATION.csv.gz. A year not downloaded yet is first
# unpacked from the project's mirror (GitHub Releases, see lib.sh), if it has
# that year. Then any station still missing is fetched from IEM: by default the
# stations for each year are those of the airports flown that year in
# faa.ontime, via faa.airport_station (so load flights and stations first).
# Existing files are kept; --refresh fetches every station again from IEM, e.g.
# to bring the current year up to date.
